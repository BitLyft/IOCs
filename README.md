# BitLyft SOC Team - IOC Repository

Welcome to the **BitLyft SOC Team's IOC Repository**. This repository is a collection of **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)** that our SOC team has identified, validated, and is sharing with the community to help improve threat intelligence and proactive security measures.

## 📌 About This Repository

BitLyft's Security Operations Center (SOC) continuously monitors and analyzes threat intelligence feeds, security events, and attack patterns. The IOCs provided here are derived from:

- **Active Investigations** - Real-world incidents analyzed by our SOC analysts.
- **Threat Intelligence Feeds** - Aggregated from multiple trusted sources.
- **Customer Reports** - Anonymized and verified indicators from our security monitoring.
- **Malware Analysis** - Extracted from sandbox analysis and reverse engineering efforts.

These indicators can help security teams, researchers, and organizations detect, mitigate, and respond to cyber threats more effectively.
